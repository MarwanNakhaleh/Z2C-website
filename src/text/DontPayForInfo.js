    problems: "Coding bootcamps will charge you tens of thousands of dollars to \"teach you how to code.\" Unfortunately, you'll often find either that the curriculum didn't measure up to expectations, they don't provide adequate career support, or you don't even get taught, you just have to read and practice curriculum on your own.",
    costs: "Even worse, if you don't have the tens of thousands of dollars up front, you often have to sign an \"income-share agreement\", where the bootcamp gets 10-15% of your income for the next several years! Imagine working your way up to a $100,000 salary, and then you have to pay $15,000 of that back to a coding bootcamp where you didn't even get much support!",
    flexibility: "But wait, what about part-time flexible coding bootcamps?"
