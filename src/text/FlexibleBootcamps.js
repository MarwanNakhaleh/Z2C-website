    intro: "There are several major problems too with \"cheaper\", \"flexible\" part-time coding bootcamps where you pay per week or per month until the program is finished.",
    firstProblem: "First, they often claim the curriculum pace is part-time, but you'll put in the hours and still feel behind because they don't pace the material realistically for most people.",
    secondProblem: "Second, the support you get in the first place is very disjointed and often doesn't work with your schedule. You join the flexible bootcamp because you want to study and receive at the times that work best for you, but they run at their own times.",
    thirdProblem: "Finally, they cut you off from support and mentorship at their set end date, regardless of how ready you are for the software developer job market. You just blew close to $10,000 to teach yourself material you can find online, and you received next to no help through the experience. What a horrible experience!",
